✅ 1. pandas==2.0.3
Purpose:
This is your core library for reading Excel files (.xlsx), manipulating tabular data, filtering, grouping, and extracting student-specific schedules from the general timetable.

Usage in your project:
Load the Excel timetable, extract rows per student or section, and format it for image generation or display.

Difficulty: 🟢 Medium
You’ll need to understand DataFrames, indexing, filtering, and basic data manipulation – which is manageable with practice.

✅ 2. openpyxl==3.1.2
Purpose:
This is a dependency of pandas for reading and writing .xlsx Excel files.

Usage in your project:
You don’t use it directly, but pandas.read_excel() uses it internally to load Excel timetables.

Difficulty: 🟢 Easy (Handled automatically)
You don’t need to write any openpyxl code unless you're manually editing Excel files (which is not necessary here).

✅ 3. streamlit==1.25.0
Purpose:
Streamlit is the frontend framework for building your web app interface in Python.

Usage in your project:
Upload Excel file, select student name or ID, display image timetable, show buttons and user inputs.

Difficulty: 🟢 Easy to Medium
Streamlit is beginner-friendly. The challenge is in organizing the flow and integrating it smoothly with backend logic.

✅ 4. pillow==10.0.0
Purpose:
Pillow (PIL) is for image creation, editing, and saving.

Usage in your project:
You’ll use it to generate the visual timetable images (text + colored cells per slot) and save or display them.

Difficulty: 🟢 Medium
Creating grid layouts and aligning text/images takes trial and error but is learnable with small experiments.

✅ 5. matplotlib==3.7.2
Purpose:
For data visualization and plotting.

Usage in your project (optional):
If you want to plot timetable stats like number of classes/day, free slots, etc., or build charts inside your app.

Difficulty: 🟡 Medium
Plotting graphs is easy with examples, but customizing plots takes time to master.

✅ 6. plotly==5.15.0
Purpose:
Another graphing library, used for interactive visualizations in the browser (better than matplotlib in interactivity).

Usage in your project (optional):
If you want interactive timetable stats or schedule visualizations, Plotly is helpful. For example: hovering to see course info in a visual timetable.

Difficulty: 🟡 Medium to Hard
Requires a learning curve for customization. But not required unless you're aiming for advanced interactive charts.

🔎 Summary Table
Library	Required	Purpose	Difficulty
pandas	✅ Yes	Data loading + filtering	Medium
openpyxl	✅ Yes	Backend engine for Excel reading	Easy
streamlit	✅ Yes	Web app interface	Easy–Medium
pillow	✅ Yes	Generate timetable images	Medium
matplotlib	❌ Optional	For basic visual plots/statistics	Medium
plotly	❌ Optional	For interactive visualizations	Medium–Hard

✅ Recommendations
Start with only these 4: pandas, openpyxl, streamlit, pillow.

Skip matplotlib and plotly unless you want to add graphs or analytics later.

Add them modularly when your core timetable generation is complete.
